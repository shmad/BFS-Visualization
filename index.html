    <p class="explanation">
      This program helps with the visualization of a very common serch algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS). <br> This alogorithm is typically used to find the shortest path between 2 points.
    </p>

  <p class="explanation">
    The grid size and shape can be changed by entering how many rows and columns you want then hitting change grid. <br> The max number of each is 50 cells, and there must be at least 2 cells of either.
    <br><br> The starting cell will be red with an S and the targets will be black with a T followed by the target number on the inside.
    <br>All the open cells will be white, and any obstruction will be gray. To start a slow motion search, first change <br> 
    the time in the delay box then hit start search. A smaller number will speed up the search. If the search area is big, <br>
    don't make the number too large or it will take a long time to finish. Hitting the quick search button will immediately show<br>
    the result. 
    Orange will represent the current cell the algorithm is at, green will represent cells that have been added to the <br>queue to search next.
    Blues cells are the cells that have already been considered. Yellow will represent the shortest path. <br>The path can only consist
    of horizontal and vertical movements. After a search is done, altering the grid via the toggles will<br> immediately show the new search reuslts.
    <br><br>
    The add and remove target buttons do exactly what they say, there can be up to 3 targets. Clear search will clear the search<br>
    results but leave the obstacles and clear grid will clear everything but the start and targets. <br><br>
    The toggles will allow you to change the search area. Toggling to add obstacles (gray cells), will allow you to click and drag <br>
    over the cells you want to be impassable. Toggling start will allow you to move the starting location and toggling destination <br>
    will allow you to move any of the existing targets.
